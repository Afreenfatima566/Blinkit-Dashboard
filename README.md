The dashboard was developed using the following tools and technologies:

Source: FMCG retail sales dataset (Blinkit-inspired dataset)
The dataset contains transactional and master data related to:
Outlet details (location tier, size, type, establishment year)
Item attributes
Sales values, profit margins, and item visibility
Customer ratings
This structured dataset enables multi-dimensional analysis across outlets, products, and time.

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem

In the quick-commerce and FMCG retail domain, organizations handle large volumes of product and outlet data. However, identifying high-performing outlets, profitable product categories, and customer satisfaction drivers becomes difficult without a consolidated analytical view.

Key questions include:
Which outlet types generate the highest sales?
How does outlet size and location impact revenue?
Which product categories contribute most to total sales?
Are customer ratings consistent across outlet types?

• Goal of the Dashboard

The primary objective of this dashboard is to:

Provide a 360° view of sales and profitability
Compare performance across outlet locations, sizes, and types
Identify top-selling and underperforming product categories
Support strategic decisions related to expansion, inventory planning, and marketing
